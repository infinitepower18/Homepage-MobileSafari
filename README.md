# Homepage for Safari iOS/visionOS

With this extension, you can set any URL and Safari will automatically load your homepage upon opening a new tab.

Unlike macOS, Safari on iOS and visionOS doesn't have the ability to set a homepage, so this extension was created to solve this.

To load your homepage whenever a new tab is opened, ensure the extension is enabled and that this app is set under Open New Tabs in Safari Settings.
