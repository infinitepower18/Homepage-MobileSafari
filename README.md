# Homepage for Safari iOS/visionOS

With this extension, you can set any URL and Safari will automatically load your homepage upon opening a new tab.

Unlike macOS, Safari on iOS and visionOS doesn't have the ability to set a homepage, so this extension was created to solve this.

To load your homepage whenever a new tab is opened, ensure the extension is enabled and that this app is set under Open New Tabs in Safari Settings.

The app also contains a shortcut to change your homepage URL, which can be used as part of other shortcuts and automations.

## Translations

Community translations are welcome. The locale file is located in `Homepage/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`. If your language isn't yet supported, it will fallback to English.

The default page when no homepage is set has its own locale file, which can be found in `HomepageExtension/Resources/translations.json`.

If you are editing with Xcode, make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode 16.

Future updates to strings will involve updating all languages using Google Translate or some other machine translation service. As you may know, these services are not always accurate, so if you see any inaccuracies, please make a pull request!
