# Homepage for Safari iOS/visionOS

With this extension, you can set any URL and Safari will automatically load your homepage upon opening a new tab.

Unlike macOS, Safari on iOS and visionOS doesn't have the ability to set a homepage, so this extension was created to solve this.

To load your homepage whenever a new tab is opened, ensure the extension is enabled and that this app is set under Open New Tabs in Safari Settings.

Community translations are welcome. The locale file is located in `Homepage/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`. If your language isn't yet supported, it will fallback to English.
