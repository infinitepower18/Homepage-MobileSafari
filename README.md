# Homepage for Safari iOS/visionOS

With this extension, you can set any URL and Safari will automatically load your homepage upon opening a new tab.

Unlike macOS, Safari on iOS and visionOS doesn't have the ability to set a homepage, so this extension was created to solve this.

To set up, enable the extension and ensure it is set as the new tab page. To set the homepage URL of your choice:

1. Open your device's settings app

2. Select the Safari app followed by Extensions

3. Select the extension and tap Settings
